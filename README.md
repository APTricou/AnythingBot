# Anything Bot - A Discord Bot

 I built this bot with intentions of using it simply for myself and my friends, but as I continue to add functionality and change the bot, I may make the bot publicly available and ramp up its processing.

 Built primarily using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)
 and an ever extending list of extensions:
 [Youtube downloader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ytdl-core)
 [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/)


 deployed through [Heroku](htttp://www.heroku.com)

 A special thanks to [Discord](http://www.discordapp.com) for making my favorite chat application.
